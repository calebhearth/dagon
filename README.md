# The Esoteric Order of Dagon

This is a language designed and implemented by [Caleb Thompson](/calebthompson) and [Goose Mongeau](/halogenandtoast).

You can call it Dagon for short.


## Dagon As She is Wrote

```
fibonacci-recursive(n): # fuckin hyphens instead of underscores.
  if n <= 1, return n  #leading conditionals. comma rather than semicolon to separate statements
  self(n - 1) + self(n - 2)
```

```
fibonacci-imperative(n):
  current: 0
  next: 1

  n.times
    temp: next
    next +: current
    current: temp

  current
```

### Hello

```
puts "Hello World"

Outputs strings "Hello " "World\n" (same result as above):

```
print "Hello "
print "World\n"
```
